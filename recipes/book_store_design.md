# Books Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

## 1. Design and create the Table

(Table is already created in the database, so skipping this step.)

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "public"."books";
-- This script only contains the table creation statements and does not fully represent the table in the database. It's still missing: indices, triggers. Do not use it as a backup.

-- Sequence and defined type
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS books_id_seq;

-- Table Definition
CREATE TABLE "public"."books" (
    "id" SERIAL,
    "title" text,
    "author_name" text,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

INSERT INTO "public"."books" ("id", "title", "author_name") VALUES
(1, 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell'),
(2, 'Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf'),
(3, 'Emma', 'Jane Austen'),
(4, 'Dracula', 'Bram Stoker'),
(5, 'The Age of Innocence', 'Edith Wharton');
```

Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_{table_name}.sql
```

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```ruby
# Model class
# (in lib/book.rb)
class Book
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.rb)
class BookRepository
end
```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```ruby
class Book
  attr_accessor :id, :title, :author_name
end
```

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```ruby
# Table name: books

# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.rb)

class BookRepository

  # Selecting all records
  # No arguments
  def all
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, title FROM books;

    # Returns an array of book objects.
  end

  # Gets a single record by its ID
  # One argument: the id (number)
  def find(id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, title FROM books WHERE id = $1;

    # Returns a single book object.
  end

  # Add more methods below for each operation you'd like to implement.

  # def create(book)
  # end

  # def update(book)
  # end

  # def delete(book)
  # end
end
```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

```ruby
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all books

repo = BookRepository.new

books = repo.all
books.length # => 3

books[0].id # => 1
books[0].title # => 'Nine Princes in Amber'

books[1].id # => 2
books[1].title # => 'The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth'

# 2
# Get a single book

repo = BookRepository.new

book = repo.find(1)

book.id # => 1
book.title # => 'Nine Princes in Amber'

# Add more examples for each method
```

Encode this example as a test.

## 7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run

Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/book_repository_spec.rb

def reset_books_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_books.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'book_store_test', user: 'postgres' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe BookRepository do
  before(:each) do
    reset_books_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
```

## 8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
